# Smart Driving Assist System

> YOLOv8 기반 보행자 및 차선 탐지 + 실시간 음성 알림 + 상황 요약 시스템
A real-time pedestrian and lane detection system using YOLOv8.  
The system provides audio alerts and generates contextual summaries based on the current road environment using the OpenAI API.

## Project Overview

This project implements a lightweight, real-time driving assist system that:
- Detects pedestrians using an object detection model (YOLOv8)
- Identifies lane boundaries using both traditional and deep learning-based methods
- Provides TTS-based audio alerts for critical events (e.g., pedestrian detected, lane departure)
- Generates natural language summaries of the current driving context via ChatGPT

## Features

- Pedestrian detection with YOLOv8
- Lane detection using Canny + Hough transform or segmentation
- Audio feedback using TTS (pyttsx3 or gTTS)
- Contextual summarization with ChatGPT API
